## What is BunORM ðŸ¤”

BunORM is a ORM implementation for bun:sqlite that makes it easy to manage your bun:sqlite database by not only providing a simple to use interface, but also really good typescript support
<br />
(This package is still in an very early state so dont expect to much lol)
<br />
<br />

## Features ðŸ˜¯

1. âš¡ BLAZINGLY FAST
2. ðŸ˜® Tiny no-dependencies package
2. ðŸ”¤ Bestest autocompletion due to really good typescript types
3. ðŸ’» Easy to use interface inspired by <a href="https://typeorm.io">TypeORM</a>
4. Supports following cool features out of the box:
    - Custom data types like "JSON" with full type support (so you dont have to cast ðŸ˜‰)
    - Middleware support (get/set)
    - Custom functions that will be added to the row objects
    - Relations between tables (also with type support)
    - Automatic Id, createdAt and updatedAt properties
<br />
<br />

## Installation

Stable release
```bash
bun install bunorm
```

Dev release
```bash

## Usage

Just import the package

    tables: {
        roles: {
            columns: {
                name: {
                    type: "TEXT",
                },
            },
        },
        users: {
            columns: {
                username: {
                    type: "TEXT",
                },
                password: {
                    type: "TEXT",
                },
                userData: {
                    type: "JSON",
                },
            },
